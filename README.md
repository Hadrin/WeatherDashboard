Weather Dashboard

Website allows the user to search a location and get both the current and upcoming weather for the location. The website will keep track of which locations have been recently searched and provides buttons to easily re-enter recently searched forecasts. History is stored in session storage so users do not need to remain on the site to retain their history.
